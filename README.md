ever since fallout 3 terminals have spawned many thoughts like "why can't I do _____" , why can't I write things in here now you can!

the project is functionly dos and can run most dos compatable software, even fallout 1 (meta i know)
it can run in virtualbox or flash it onto a usb and boot it up on a physical computer (yes it supports early ibm pc's too) if you want the true fallout experiance 
it works with vga graphics or monochrome (yummy crystals in screen) 
in future versions i will include more higher level drivers and will support it until i relece pipboy os (it will still get  a update if a huge bug is found )
the next major version it will include 
- a cdrom driver
- large dos partition support
- tools to make setting up fallout1 more simple for non tech-geek users
